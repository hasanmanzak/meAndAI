# FEAT-0066 Test Scenarios

Test implementation: not started; development is not authorized.

| ID | Related slice | Scenario | Expected result | Level | Intent review | Status | Automation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TEST-0212` <a name="test-0212"></a> | [SUBF-0145](README.md#subf-0145) | Vary authority-set generation, actor roles, capability composition, grant subject/target/operation, expiry, freshness, replay, role conflicts, plan identity, publication envelope, extension activation, and concurrent CAS. | Only one fresh, separated, exact, non-transitive grant can authorize the matching unchanged operation; stale, replayed, broadened, conflicting, drifted, or losing-CAS attempts fail before mutation. | Unit / contract / concurrency / security | Nearest same-contract sibling: [TEST-0105](../FEAT-0020-v095-streamed-codex-cancellation/test-cases.md#test-0105); Distinct shared typed authority/grant/CAS foundation rather than one workflow lease. | Planned | Future .NET tests |
| `TEST-0213` <a name="test-0213"></a> | [SUBF-0146](README.md#subf-0146) | Interrupt every journal phase; vary lease expiry, fencing, duplicate delivery, receipt replay, partial persistence, corruption, retention boundary, reconstruction, recovery grant, and competing engine. | Reconstruction returns one deterministic terminal or recovery-required state, stale actors cannot commit, duplicate delivery is idempotent, corruption fails closed, and only the explicitly granted engine can resume. | Component / persistence / recovery / concurrency | Nearest same-contract sibling: [TEST-0125](../FEAT-0028-v0104-atomic-legacy-updater-recovery/test-cases.md#test-0125); Distinct reusable cross-application journal and recovery contract. | Planned | Future .NET persistence and crash-fixture tests |

## Required coverage

- Grant construction, consumption, expiry, revocation, and replay.
- Separation of duties and non-transitive capability composition.
- CAS, lease, fence, journal, receipt, retention, corruption, interruption, and
  deterministic reconstruction.
- Single-engine recovery across local and provider-backed application adapters.

## Evidence

No implementation, baseline, or run evidence exists. A historical engine-state
enum or workflow lease is not evidence for this foundation.
