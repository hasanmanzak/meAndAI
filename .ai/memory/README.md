The maintainer accepted
[DEC-0035](../../docs/decisions/DEC-0035-protocol-owned-governance-and-execution-architecture.md)
on 2026-07-29. Follow the accepted
[architecture](../../docs/architecture/protocol-governance-and-execution/README.md),
[successor plan](../../docs/architecture/protocol-governance-and-execution/successor-delivery-plan.md),
[WIP extraction ledger](../../docs/architecture/protocol-governance-and-execution/wip-extraction-ledger.md),
and [architecture-acceptance handoff](log/2026-07-29-protocol-governance-execution-architecture-acceptance.md).
The product is one versioned executable protocol platform implemented in C#,
not a collection of CLI products. Implementation authority remains withheld;
no WIP extraction, workflow change, consumer mutation, release publication,
authority transfer, or PowerShell retirement is authorized.

This directory is the portable, curated handoff between the maintainer and AI
collaborators. It is not the common memory of consuming projects. Each consumer
creates its own `.ai/memory` outside the protocol submodule.

Read in this order:

1. [Project snapshot](project.md)
2. The current continuation identified in the [log index](log/README.md)
3. Canonical feature and decision documents linked by those records

Memory ownership and boundaries are defined by
[DEC-0002](../../docs/decisions/DEC-0002-project-local-memory.md).

## Recording rules

- Store durable project facts and collaboration constraints, not raw chat.
- Mark assumptions and open questions explicitly.
- Link to issues, pull requests, features, decisions, tests, or commits.
- Keep current tool, environment, integration, and implementation routes in the
  [Active recurrence knowledge](project.md#active-recurrence-knowledge) section
  of the project snapshot. These entries are routing evidence, never executable
  regression evidence. Retain a concise `Stale` or `Superseded` routing
  tombstone in the active index and move only its detailed history to dated
  logs.
- Date facts that may become stale.
- Correct obsolete entries with a new record; do not silently rewrite history.
- Never store credentials or unrelated project details here.
