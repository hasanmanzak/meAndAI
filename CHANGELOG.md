# Changelog

This project uses the `M.m.rev` version format defined in the
[common protocol](PROTOCOL.md#8-versioning).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- A consumer-owned scheduled and manually dispatched workflow that proposes
  same-major protocol updates as draft pull requests.
- A fail-closed update resolver and thin GitHub adapter with replacement-first
  supersession of older managed update pull requests and branches.
- Collision-safe adoption mapping for the workflow and its scripts.
  Candidate ownership uses one canonical marker and live planned-head binding,
  with expected-state leases and compensation around non-atomic GitHub cleanup.
- Cross-platform repository validation on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu and Windows
  PowerShell, plus race, pagination, origin, marker, and local Git lease
  fixtures.

### Migration

- Consumers already pinned to immutable `v0.1.0` need one manual upgrade to
  `v0.2.0` and one-time updater installation. New `v0.2.0` adopters receive the
  updater assets during initial adoption.
- Repository-reference consumers require a provider-specific deterministic
  adapter or manual reviewed upgrades; the generic workflow updates only the
  recommended `.ai/protocol` Git submodule.
