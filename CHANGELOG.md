# Changelog

This project uses the `M.m.rev` version format defined in the
[common protocol](PROTOCOL.md#8-versioning).


## 0.3.1 - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Clarified that urgent work may compress elapsed time but cannot reorder gates
  or authorize implementation before Definition of Ready.
- Required concise evidence to exist before its gate and routed real deviations
  through the existing numbered-decision process instead of retrospective
  evidence.
- Added executable `TEST-0020` coverage for the urgent-work contract.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added a bounded post-development full-project convergence scan that records
  findings, resolves them from highest to lowest priority, and requires zero
  unresolved actionable in-scope findings for completion.
- Added explicit scope, validation-budget, progress, and blocked-state controls
  so repeated scans cannot become an unchanged review loop.
- Added [FEAT-0003](docs/features/FEAT-0003-convergent-completion-scan/README.md),
  [DEC-0004](docs/decisions/DEC-0004-bounded-completion-convergence.md), and
  executable `TEST-0019` contract coverage.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Bounded normal self-validation to one fresh-diff review and one final
  verification command; only blocking findings reopen delivery scope.
- Prohibited recursive validator/bootstrap chains without a concrete risk and
  numbered decision, while retaining explicit full-scan triggers.
- Separated common consumer assets from submodule-only updater assets.
- Tightened the documented orphan-branch recovery checks for default branch,
  gitlink mode, and target tag without adding automation.
- Removed unused `issues: write` permission and corrected small contract and
  historical test-description drift.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- A consumer-owned scheduled and manually dispatched workflow that proposes
  same-major protocol updates as draft pull requests.
- A fail-closed update resolver and thin GitHub adapter with replacement-first
  supersession of older managed update pull requests and branches.
- Collision-safe adoption mapping for the workflow and its scripts.
  Candidate ownership uses one canonical marker and live planned-head binding,
  with expected-state leases and compensation around non-atomic GitHub cleanup.
- Cross-platform repository validation on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu and Windows
  PowerShell, plus race, pagination, origin, marker, and local Git lease
  fixtures.

### Migration

- Consumers already pinned to immutable `v0.1.0` need one manual upgrade to
  `v0.2.0` and one-time updater installation. New `v0.2.0` adopters receive the
  updater assets during initial adoption.
- Repository-reference consumers require a provider-specific deterministic
  adapter or manual reviewed upgrades; the generic workflow updates only the
  recommended `.ai/protocol` Git submodule.
